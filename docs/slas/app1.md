# App1 SLA

In addition to the [standard SLA](./quantum.md), we provide the following service for Nexus:

* Scheduled maintenance periods are communicated at least 2 hours in advance.
* Requests are prioritized among other activities in the team [Kanban Board](https://jiralink.com).
* For permissions that follow an established template, we attempt to fix within 24 hours (for example, adding a user to an established team).
* For new permissions or new accounts, we prioritize among other work. We communicate if this work is in or out of the current sprint/PI (2 weeks/4 weeks).
* Service and Tools logs are kept for 24 hours.
* Service and Tools monitoring statistics are kept for 24 hours.
