# GitHub Enterprise (GHE) SLA

In general, we can only help with repositories and permissions for the CWP or HP ID accounts for the https://github.azc.ext.hp.com GitHub Enterprise instance. We'll defer most other issues to the GitHub Enterprise team itself.

In addition to the [standard SLA](./gadget.md), we provide the following service for the GitHub Enterprise pieces that we're responsible for:

* Requests are prioritized among other activities in the team [Kanban Board](https://jira.cso-hp.com:8443/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=607).
* In general, we'll let the GHE team manage as many of the outages as possible. Check with them on Yammer as needed: [https://www.yammer.com/hp.com/#/threads/inGroup?type=in_group&feedId=6603278](https://www.yammer.com/hp.com/#/threads/inGroup?type=in_group&feedId=6603278).
