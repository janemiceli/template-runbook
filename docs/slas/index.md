# SLAs

A service-level agreement (SLA) is defined as an official commitment that prevails between a service provider and the customer. Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed upon between the service provider and the service user.

The general SLA of the team is available [here](team.md).

Individual SLAs contain additional information specific to each service:
