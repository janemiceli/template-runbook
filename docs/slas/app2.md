# App2 SLA

In addition to the [standard SLA](./quantum.md), we provide the following service for AWS permissions:

* Requests are prioritized among other activities in the team [Kanban Board](https://jira.cso-hp.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=608).
* The AWS status page is available [here](https://status.aws.amazon.com/).
* We work with Amazon to resolve any service issues you encounter.
* For permissions that follow an established template, we attempt to fix within 24 hours (for example, adding a user to an established team).
* For new permissions or new accounts, we prioritize among other work. We communicate if this work is in or out of the current sprint/PI (2 weeks/4 weeks).
