----------

This is a playbook for  team members and guests who have knowledge and training on how to perform this work.  We expect to place here code/examples/policies or other information that we find useful to maintaining our services.  If you're an end user of the service you might be happier to read the user guides instead of this document. General information on how to use the service is available in the [ User Guide](../..//index.md).

Our team does not currently do any setup to enable the ECR in an account/region.  It ships with AWS by default.  This may change if/when we move from many little ECRs to one consolidated account.  Most users need to be set up with permissions to use the ECR.  This is covered in more detail in [UserPermissions](../index.md).

Developers invited to an account should have access to the repo.

Service accounts must be given this permission explicitly.  See the playbooks on user permissions for more details.
