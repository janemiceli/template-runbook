Playbooks
====

 Playbooks are intended to be used internally to our team.  We promise just enough information here for you to get yourself in trouble. The user guides [here](../guides/index.md) are likely more useful if you're not on the team. Please get in touch if you have any questions.

Service playbooks
====

This section groups the playbooks for the services that the Quantum team has created and manages. The playbooks are organized first by the 'service' and then by the technologies used to provide that service. For example logging has at least two bits, a server and client.  Those items might very well have different playbooks.
