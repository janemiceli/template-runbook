Start every retrospective stating the following

1. This is a blameless retrospective. 
2. We will not focus on the past events as they pertain to "could've", "should've", etc. 
3. All follow up action items will be assigned to a team/individual before the end of the meeting. If the item is not going to be top priority leaving the meeting, don't make it a follow up item. 
4. Please stick to the fact using nuetral langage; leave emotion and intention and inflamatory language out of this conversation.
5. We want to talk about both the good and bad, pretty and ulgy. We do want to highlight advances we want to take.
