Github Enterprise (GHE) User Guide
====

Gadget is not responsible for the maintenance, operation, or initial configuration of Github Enterprise.  In some ways, this limits how much we can help.  However, we always promise to do our best to help, and then if we can't help, get you to someone who can.

What we do help with is access issues to HP ID organization repos and a subset of CWP repos.

Send us an email with the work you need done, and we'll do our best to help. [hpid-infrastructure-operations@external.groups.hp.com](mailto:hpid-infrastructure-operations@external.groups.hp.com)

Yammer is the main place the GHE team publishes information.  [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/hp.com/#/threads/inGroup?type=in_group&feedId=6603278)
