# Nexus

In a nutshell Nexus is the leading open-source repository management tool. Built with Java, it supports technologies such as Docker, NuGet, NPM, Bower, PyPI and Ruby Gems.

We maintain one Nexus service for HP ID at the following location: [https://nexus.hpcwp.com](https://nexus.hpcwp.com)
