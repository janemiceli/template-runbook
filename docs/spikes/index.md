We will keep information about all of our current and finished investigations here.

### Recommended Template for Writing White Papers

The desire outcome of our investigations are white papers. Although the proposed format is not mandatory, it will help you tell the story without losing track of the investigation scope.

#### Title
A well-written title serves as a very brief abstract of your white paper. Capture the key idea(s). Keep it succinct.

#### Abstract

*In one short paragraph, summarize the key points of your white paper. The abstract provides a good opportunity to grab your readers’ attention, and convince them that your white paper is worth their time to read. Similar to the title, time should be spent developing a clear, concise, and hard-hitting abstract. Always write the abstract after you have completed your white paper.*

#### Problem Statement

In this section, briefly state the problem that your white paper solves. Ideally, describe the problem in a way that could be understood and appreciated by a hypothetical high school student. Don't be too specific -- state the problem broadly to include related problems in related fields.

#### Prior Solutions

Problems can often be solved in many different ways. If you are aware of other ways that someone else has solved this problem before, describe those prior solutions here. Be as specific as you can. If you know of specific patent numbers, publications, products, web addresses, etc., that describe these prior solutions, include this information here. Also include the shortcomings these prior solutions have (e.g., too expensive, too complex, doesn't work very well, etc.).

#### Description

You've already stated the problem and identified any prior solutions to the problem that you know about. In this section, you tell your readers the details about how you solved the problem. Be as specific as you can, but don't get off track and include stuff that has nothing to do with how you solved the problem. Where the Abstract section was like a 10 second read, this section is more like a 10-20 minute read. You should assume that the reader is a generalist who has a basic knowledge of the technical concepts addressed by your solution but does not know the specific technical details. Therefore, avoid acronyms and major logical or technical holes in the description of your solution. If you have built and tested it though, and know that it works, by all means mention this!

#### Conclusion

By this point you’ve told your readers what you’re going to tell them in the abstract; you’ve told them in the problem statement and solution; now you need to tell them what you told them. The conclusion provides the opportunity to:

* Summarize the white paper objectives.
* Review the problem statement(s).
* Highlight the solutions and their value for your audience.
* Finish with a strong statement.

#### Additional Resources

Provide a list of available resources for your audience. This may include resources you have sourced throughout the white paper.
